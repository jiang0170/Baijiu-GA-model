1. INITIALIZATION
   - Import libraries: matplotlib, pandas, sklearn ensemble/linear models, numpy
   - Set global font to Times New Roman, font size 12
   
2. DATA LOADING & PREPROCESSING
   - Read Excel dataset ('test.xlsx')
   - Extract features (first 8 columns) and labels (9th column)
   - Split data: 80% training, 20% testing
   
3. MODEL DEFINITION
   - Three models:
     * Gradient Boosting Classifier
     * Random Forest Classifier
     * Logistic Regression (max iterations: 1000)
   
4. TRAINING & EVALUATION
   FOR EACH MODEL:
     - Train on training data
     - Predict on test data
     - Calculate metrics:
       * Accuracy
       * Recall (weighted)
       * F1 Score (weighted)
       * Precision (weighted)
     - Store metrics in results dictionary
   
5. VISUALIZATION
   FOR EACH MODEL:
     - IF model supports probability predictions:
       * Generate ROC curves (multiclass):
         - Calculate ROC for each class (1-7)
         - Plot all ROC curves
         - Display AUC values
     
     - Generate confusion matrix:
       * Display as heatmap with percentages
       * Label classes as 1-7
       * Add count and percentage annotations
   
6. PREDICTION ON NEW DATA
   - Load new dataset ('1.xlsx')
   - Extract features (first 8 columns)
   - FOR EACH MODEL:
     * Predict using trained model
     * Print predictions
   
7. OUTPUT
   - Print metrics for all three models
   - Display ROC curves (where applicable) and confusion matrices
   - Print predictions on new data for each model
